### Projects

I currently have no real "portfolio worthy" projects to speak of. A few small PRs here and there but not really much.
I am planning some big things but I have a hard time trying to keep my motivation.

I like exploring new things by putting myself head first into it. It's sometimes extremely confusing and frustrating but it works for me.
